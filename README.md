# ASCII Art Generator

### Description
A simple program that converts images into ASCII art.

### Instructions
In order to use, just change image path as indicated by a comment.

### Notes
the `legacy.main` program seems to work best for smaller images while `main.py` seems to work well for much larger images where detail is wanted.
